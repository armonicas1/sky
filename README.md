<p>
This project, named sky, aims to detect and localize in satellite photos four 
specific types of cloud formations: Flower, Fish, Gravel and Sugar, so named because 
of their characteristic pattern.
</p>
<p>
The sky project is based on a 2019 <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/understanding_cloud_organization" 
target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaggle competition</a>, initiated by the Max Planck Institute. 
Main purpose was to mobilize the data scientist community on the realization of models capable of 
identifying shallow cloud locations, considered as potential key factors in climate’s understanding.
<br>
In this frame, we developed a convolutional neural network model trained to identify and localize the 
above four cloud formations.
<br>

# Present repo content

<p>
The repository structure reflects project sequence. The sky project was organized in 3 phases: 
a first exploratory analysis, the second phase aimed at implementing a multi-classification model and the third one 
aimed at implementing a segmentation model. Libraries have also been developed and are grouped under the "packages" folder (associated documentation 
is available under "docPackages" folder).<br>
The 3 related jupyter notebook are visible from the «colab» links below.
